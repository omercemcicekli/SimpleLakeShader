# Simple Lake Shader for Godot

![lake](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/437cb700-8729-4339-a88d-080273848d60)

A lightweight, beginner-friendly water (lake) shader for Godot 4.x.
It features blended normal maps for surface detail, a simple Fresnel effect, refraction, foam edges, and depth-based color blending using Beer's law.

This shader does not use vertex displacement or complex calculations — it’s designed purely for experimentation and learning.
It’s not optimized or production-ready, but feel free to use, modify, or expand it for your own projects.
